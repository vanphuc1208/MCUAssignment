This project simulates a two-way traffic signal system using the STM32F103RB (Clock is 64MHz), which has the following key features: \par
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Automatic mode}: The system operates as normal. Green, yellow, and red are the light colors. \par
    \item \textbf{Manual mode}: This option allows you to change the light colors by pressing a button. \par
    \item \textbf{Tuning mode}: This option allows you to change the duration of the light timing. \par
    \item \textbf{Pedestrian scramble}: Upon pressing the pedestrian's button, the light turns on and functions in opposition to the vehicle's light. \par
\end{itemize}
